2FAS - Two Factor Authentication strengthens WP-admin security by requiring an additional verification (Token, SMS, VMS) code on untrusted devices.

== Description ==

= Secure your WordPress Administration area with 2FAS plugin. =

Each time you log in to the WordPress admin area, 2FAS determines whether or not the User is required to enter a TOTP, SMS or VMS token as an additional form of authentication.

2FAS uses industry standard TOTP tokens, the same kind used by:

* Google Authenticator
* Microsoft Authenticator
* Authy
* FreeOTP
* and many others…

2FAS's Two Factor Authentication is available to all users as soon as it's installed. Each User has to configure his own secret key, for example by scanning a QR Code.

= Brute-force attacks =

When undergoing a brute-force attack, your password can be discovered by the attacker. This is the only vulnerability you will experience with 2FAS. 2FAS's intelligent security feature provides a finite amount of time in which the attacker access the correct token. After the access period has ended, the attacker is locked out for security reasons.

= WordPress takeovers =

Many people use the same password or a similar password for many online services. Repeatedly used passwords remain are vulnerable in cyberspace. Using the 2FAS plugin on your WordPress site makes access without a 2FAS registered device very difficult.

= Phishing and keylogger attacks =

If you're not completely sure that the devices used by you or your subusers are completely free of keyloggers and viruses, then using 2FAS to protect your WordPress site from security breaches is a great solution!

Any password discovery attempt is useless with 2FAS. Without the token generated by your 2FAS, conventional access to your WordPress site is almost impossible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need the 2FAS plugin? =

If you're not completely sure your devices or ones used by your sub-users are completely free of keyloggers and viruses, then it is a great solution.
Without the token generated by your smartphone, any password discovery attempt will be useless with 2FAS plugin.

= Do I need to enter a token each time I log in to the WordPress admin? =

No, it is not necessary. The 2FAS plugin determines whether or not the user is required to enter a token as an additional form of authentication.

= What do I need to do to start using the 2FAS plugin? =

The most common way to use the 2FAS plugin is to configure your smartphone to generate tokens. You can download any Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, FreeOTP, etc.).

= Can I use a browser extension instead of my smartphone to generate tokens? =

Yes, you can; however, it isn't as safe as using your smartphone.
The main idea of the two-factor authentication is based on using different devices or channels, which can verify a user. When you are using a browser extension, then you are not protected from malware or viruses, which can catch your token.

= What methods can I use as a second factor? =

In general, our plugin offers three authentication methods: TOTP app, text message, and an automated voice call. You can choose any of them to generate the code during the second factor authentication.

= Is it free? =

It is completely free if you’re using tokens (TOTP, e.g. for Google Authenticator app).
If you’d like to use text messaging or voice call, you need to create an account at 2fas.com and see our pricing, since prices vary depending on cell phone carriers. We charge only for the messages that are sent (authentication).
